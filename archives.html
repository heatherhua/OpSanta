	        Op. Santa saved our Christmas! I thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. I recently graduated college myself and I am still having a hard time finding a job. We all thank you. My son would have had a sad Chritmas without your help. I hope one day I can help other people like they help me for Christmas. Keep up the good work you guys!<br><br>

	        I would like to take this time to thank Operation Santa for all their generosity,love and support,with out them our x-mas would have been very gloomy and sad but instead they brought us joy and happiness.We made friends with them and continue to keep in touch.I can't thank them enough.They probably are getting tired of hearing this from us but thank you very much for all your help.<br><br>
	        
	        <span class="name">Christina (2010)</span><br>
	        Operation Santa is a wonderful organization that makes me believe in the true spirit of Christmas. They were able to help me coordinate and fund my first Christmas with my volunteer family from Burma. The volunteer family were very thankful and surprised with all the gifts they received. Words could not express how thankful I was to have Operation Santa provide the necessities needed to make it all happen.<br><br>
	        
	        <span class="name">Christy (2010)</span><br>
	        I would like to state what operational Santa did for my family. I suddenly became a single mom of 3 wonderful kids. I am active duty navy so that makes being a single mom much harder. Being left to fend for myself, all the debt and bills was overwhelming. I am certain that without Operation Santa my kids Christmas would not have come true. To have them wake up on Christmas morning to all the toys brought happiness back into their faces. Thank You so much for helping my family and many more families to come.<br><br>
	        
	        <span class="name">Destini (2009)</span><br>
	        The kids and I can't express enough how appreciative we are about the gifts you delivered on Saturday. You braved the horrible weather to bring Samuel and Alexandria a smile. We can't even begin to express how much it means to us that we were chosen to participate in this program this year. Though how we were chosen remains a mystery, we are happy just the same and accept the gracious and generous gifts with humble arms!<br>
	        I've had a long hard year and 2010 can only get better and please know that your generosity during Christmas this year really helped out a lot.<br>
	        My daughter was just a little too small for the white jacket that you brought but she'll be able to fit into it next year. The kids were so surprised to see presents and it helped us get into the Christmas spirit, something I wasn't sure I could muster up this year. Although they've begged and pleaded for an early opening: we will open them on Christmas Day. They'll be the surprise gifts under the tree, especially since my kids are too old for the Santa Routine.<br>
	        The three of you were very nice and patient and laughed at my jokes, even if they weren't funny and it gives me great hope for an amazing future that young college students like yourself take time out from your busy lives to bring strangers some much appreciated CARE. My only regret is that the kids weren't here to say thank you in person and you weren't able to meet my two little angels so deserving of a little extra happiness. It helped me get into the Christmas spirit and we have since put up our tree and lights and fully decked out our house more than we ever have before in past years. Usually i just throw up the tree and don't bother getting out the rest of the decorations, but this year it just felt right to share our good fortune with our neighbors by way of Christmas-time flashing lights!~<br>
	        I wish you all the best holiday and an amazing future as well! Thanks again! I hope to be in a position next year to pay forward this good deed to another deserving family next year.<br>
	        Thanks Again!<br><br>
	        
	        <span class="name">Ellie (2010)</span><br>
	        I reached out to the people of Operation Santa in November of last year after hearing about them on the news. I immediately thought of my grandparents in need. The amazing people of Operation Santa gave my grandparents more than they could have ever asked for. On top of a delicious and very well appreciated meal, and warm clothes, they got a very much needed heater, which was the best thing they could have ask for. I was so grateful and happy that Operation Santa gave my grandparents things they needed for a warm and happy Christmas. My grandparents and I are very grateful and appreciative of the special and kind hearted people of Operation Santa.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Jennifer (2009)</span><br>
	        I just wanted to take a moment to thank you guys for what you are doing for my family. Its so refreshing to know there are such nice, good hearted and caring people out there. I'm a caring woman with a huge heart, and love to lend the helping hand. I never expect anything in return, I simply get satisfaction in making someones day brighter. I'm the kind of person that will give the shirt off my back, or the last dollar in my pocket to someone who needs it more then I. I have battled my disease for many years now, and this year has been a tough one! Though I am alive and still putting up a fight. I knew this christmas was going to be tough due to recent circumstances. We are just happy to be together, have a roof over our heads, and food to eat. After years of struggle, things are starting to look brighter. I live for my children, and spend every day fighting to make sure they have a beautiful path to adulthood.<br>
	        So once again, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to brighten the day for total strangers. May many blessings come your way. Happy Holiday...........................<br><br> 

	        <span class="name">Kareen (2009)</span><br>
	        I did enjoy the gifts. My kids didn't have any gifts under the tree so they were excited to open them. I received 4 wrapped presents and 2 gift boxes of clothes. They received a pack of paper, pens, sandwich maker, and a scrabble game. I did receive a giftcard for Walmart that will come in handy. I want to say thanks to you and all your organization for the help that you were able to give me and my family. Have a great Christmas....<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Kellie (2009)</span><br>
	        I really can't put into words exactly what this has done for my family. All weekend I have been thinking of you guys and what a wonderful gift you have given us (everytime I try and think of words to express my graditude I start to cry).<br>
	        Our family was so greatful when they walked in with food, some presents, diapers, and wipes. We all were like wow that's alot of stuff. then they said "We have more stuff". I couldn't believe it. So out into the rain they went again and came back with a ton of more items. By that time I tried to be quiet. I knew if I tried to talk or say anything I would cry, and I didn't want my children to see me cry. They even brought a tree for us!<br>
	        I know they all thought they were doing something nice and I know that made them feel great. What they don't know is by giving to our family they have instilled a great urge with our children to give too! My children could not understand how these people who never met us (I'm crying again) could give so much. I explained to my children that when people help you out in life that you have to pay it foward and do something for someone else in need.<br>
	        When we were putting away the food the boys were all excited. We have been receiving food from the food bank, crisis house and some churches lately. So they were so excited to see good cereal, mac and cheese, crackers, oatmeal, good soups they like, and snacks like pudding, poptarts and granola bars. The one thing they were soooo excited about was all the baby food. It's so cute to watch them get excited about food for their little brother.<br>
	        I guess I was just overwelmed by how much they brought. It just made my heart explode with joy. Just seeing the diapers and wet wipes were such a blessing that I'm not sure your group could understand, thinking something as simple as diapers could make us so happy.<br>
	        Saturday was also my baby's birthday. He turned 1. Later that day when I was cooking dinner, it made me happy to open our cubbards and see,,,,,,,food! It was filled to the max! Thank you for that.<br>
	        Like I said before, I can't put into quick words what this has done for my family. The presents they brought are sitting under the tree, waiting to be opened on Christmas morning. All the people involved with Operation Santa 09 will be in our thought and prayers on Christmas day and the rest of our lives. Your group and You have gone above and beyond our dreams. We expected so little, and you gave so much. We thank you for giving us the privledge and honor to know you, and to be able to give our children something nice for christmas. You will now and forever be in our hearts and prayers.<br><br>

	        We would like to THANK Alpha Phi Omega and also who nominated our family! We are extremely grateful for special people who think of others' well being (which are not too many out there!). These Gifts mean alot to us and we appreciate them very much! May God bless you all and give you what you have given our family ! THANKS SOOO MUCH !!!!<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Suzanne (2010)</span><br>
	        Last year my family was not in a very good situation, we were basically homeless, and jobless living with a friend. Operations Santa brought over a few nice gifts for my children and made their Christmas very special.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Trina Jenkins (2011)</span><br>
	        I nominated my sister and her family, she was thrilled as were the kids. They not only received the gifts they wanted but the visit from your elves was awesome!! thank you so much for your generosity and your dedication to serving the community and those less fortunate. Your sacrifice, and caring for others will always be remembered. <br>
	        I think it is great what your program stands for and all your teammates hard work is really appreciated.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Ericka (2012)</span><br>
	        Last year on October 24th, I was diagnosed w/ leukemia and spent over a month and a half in the hospital. I was very sick and unable to return to work and the doctors were unable to provide me with a date that I might return to work. I am a single mother and the holidays sometimes are tuff but I have never been in such a hard position, especially with the holidays fast approaching. There was a few special people that were a part of Operation Santa that came to our home just before Christmas and brought my kids and I some very special and thoughtful gifts. They even made me feel so special by giving me a handful of gifts too. I never felt so blessed than I did that day. My kids went though so much while I was sick and for that moment, I saw their faces light up with happiness and surprise. My daughter still rides the princess bike they brought her. As a parent, just seeing my kids SO ECSTATIC made me feel such a sense of relief ~ at their age, they would never understand why Santa couldn't come to their house BUT he certainly did! Thank you all so much for the thought, time and compassion the team put into providing and making a special Christmas for my family and I.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Cathy Yu, Alpha Kappa Psi (2012)</span><br>
	        Alpha Kappa Psi absolutely loved adopting our two families! We have been an avid fan of Operation Santa since we partnered with them a few years ago. We rented out a Santa costume, and had so much fun surprising all the families with goodies we had brought them. This has truly been an amazing experience and we hope to work with Operation Santa again in the future!<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Jayme Freel (2012)</span><br>
	        I absolutely LOVED shopping for gifts for this family! Just imagining that the kids can still believe in santa and just the miracle of helping people out brings so much joy to my heart! Operation Santa made it so simple by getting the names and what they wanted!<br><br>

	        <span class="name">April Decker (2011)</span><br>
	        It was great fun to be Santa's helper this year. My family has adorable little girls, and they were so excited. When they opened their clothing gifts, their eyes became huge, and they were so happy. I was impressed how unspoiled those girls were. They never counted their gifts or compared them to make sure one did not receive more than the other. I learned that they had not had any new outfits since their dad lost his job two years ago. It was an incredible experience to be able to make those children happy.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Coral Craig, Cobham Sensor Systems, Admin Assistant III (2010)</span><br>
	        Working with Miller Huang and his group from UCSD fulfilled the dreams of less unfortunate families in the community. I first heard about Operation Santa from Hula from Star 94.1 after I inquired about how to get involved in the community and sponsoring a program that our organization could help families in the community that would be touched by our generosity. From the start Miller and his fellow team members were friendly and receptive to the offer to help those in the community. Our organization alone helped 3 families fulfill the wish of parent and children to have a holiday they won't soon forget. This was a program that our organization will continue to work with to help support families in need during the holiday season.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Viven Chau, AMSA, Community Service Co-Director (2010)</span><br>
	        Operation Santa is a fantastic experience. It brought our organization closer together as we picked out and delivered the presents to the two families in need. The joy expressed by each member of our adopted families showed us the potential that kindness and generosity can have in making someone else's life just a little better.<br><br>

	        <span class="name">Cindy Valverde, HMP3, President (2010)</span><br>
	        HMP3 really enjoyed adopting a family for Christmas last year! It was really nice to see our board members work together to find donations and purchase gifts for the family. The best part was seeing the family's reaction when we arrived with all their gifts. The children's faces lit up and the mother started crying; they were so thankful to have been blessed with a helping hand. Soon after, they sent us a thank-you note with a personal message from every family member. This was definitely a memorable experience!
