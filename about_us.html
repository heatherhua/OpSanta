    		    <p><br>We are college students at UC San Diego (UCSD) who are members of a co-ed community service organization called <a href="https://www.apo.org/Home" class="apolinks">Alpha Phi Omega</a>. Our chapter at UCSD is referred to as <a href="http://www.aporhopi.org" class="apolinks">"Rho Pi"</a> and our chapter performs thousands of hours of community service in San Diego each year. Alpha Phi Omega is a 501c3 organization and donations may be tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

			    <p><br>Operation Santa is an annual relief program in San Diego initiated by Alpha Phi Omega at UCSD (Rho Pi Chapter) to provide a Christmas to families in San Diego that cannot afford gifts for their children.  Our goal is to help out as many kids and families as possible experience a true Christmas by bringing gifts and food!<br><br>
			    Since we recently have been receiving an overwhelming number of requests from families for help, we solicit assistance from other groups at UCSD and the San Diego community to adopt families who we were unable to fund. Thus, the delivery to some of the nominated families will be carried out by non-APO members.
			  </p></div>
			  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in" id="howtogetinvolved">
			  	<p><br><h4>1. Nominate a family in need</h4>
			  	We accept nominations of families in need from all around San Diego County. You can either nominate your own family or the families of your friends, neighbors, or co-workers. We chose the families most in need from these nominations and we try our best to help them out!<br><br>
			  	<h4>2. Adopt a family in need</h4>
			  	You can sign up to be an adopter of these nominated families. By adopting, you will be helping a family during the holiday season. You will receive the nominated family's wishlist and from there you can shop for gifts and basic necessities for the family. You will also have the opportunity to contact your adopted family directly and deliver the gifts personally!<br><br>
			  	<h4>3. Make a monetary/non-monetary donation</h4>
			  	We accept both monetary and non-monetary donations year round!<br>
			  	Check out our donation button on the home page for more information!
			  </p></div>
			  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in" id="howitworks">
			    <p><br><h4>Finding families that need help</h4>
			    Around early-October, we begin posting flyers at various establishments in different San Diego counties (e.g. La Mesa, Lakeside, El Cajon, Chula Vista, National City, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley) that contain our contact email address, deadline to receive nominations, and the information we require about the nominated family.<br>
			    We also have been fortunate enough to receive air time from local radio and TV morning shows to promote awareness of our project and solicit nominations sent to our email address (see our "Archives" tab).<br>
			    After our deadline passes, the Operation Santa committee will make the decision on which families we can help based on their needs and our current funding situation.<br><br>

			    <h4>After families have been selected</h4>
			    Once families have been selected, they will be notified via email and phone, and a wish list will be requested during the phone call. The Operation Santa committee will then purchase and wrap the gifts, and deliver the gifts to the families at their residence by mid-December.<br><br>

			    <h4>Our funds</h4>
			    Since we are college students, we are limited by the amount of funds we can raise. Our organization (APO) budgets a set amount for the project each year (based on membership dues that have been paid), and some of our own members/alumni are generous enough to donate out of their own pockets. We also setup fundraisers and sell food on campus at UCSD. Local grocery stores (Food 4 Less, Ralphs, Vons, Henrys) and restaurants (Souplantation, Hometown Buffet) have donated gift cards and meal passes.
